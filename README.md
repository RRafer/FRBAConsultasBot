# FRBA Bot

A Telegram bot with lots of flaws, but also lots of hate to share with this world. Intended as a tool for the admins of the unofficial **Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional FRBA** Telegram group admins, this hectic mess grew uncontrolled. Now it's the code equivalent of a teenage kid with overbearing parents.

## Features

Frankly, we're mostly doing this so the kids can have some code fun, but also:

* Give more tools to admins for group moderation
* Allow chat members better access to information without depending on a human
* Improve inter-group navigation
